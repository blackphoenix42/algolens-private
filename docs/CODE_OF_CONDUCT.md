# Code of Conduct

We want AlgoLens to be a welcoming, safe place for everyone.

## Our Standards

**Be excellent to each other.** In particular:

- Be respectful and inclusive; assume good intent.
- Accept constructive feedback; disagree without being disagreeable.
- Keep discussions focused on the work; credit others’ contributions.

Unacceptable behavior includes: harassment, hate or discriminatory speech, personal attacks, doxxing, sustained disruption, or sexualized language/imagery.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, and any community channels, online or in-person events representing the project.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

- Email **security@algolens.app** (private to maintainers), or
- DM a maintainer on GitHub.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may take appropriate action, including:

1. **Correction** — a private, written warning.
2. **Warning** — continued behavior may lead to temporary ban.
3. **Temporary ban** — time-limited exclusion from project spaces.
4. **Permanent ban** — for severe or repeated violations.

Decisions are documented privately. Appeals can be sent to the same contact.

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by the spirit of the Contributor Covenant and other open community guidelines.
