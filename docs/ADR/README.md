# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

We use ADRs to document significant technical decisions for **AlgoLens**.
Each ADR captures **context → decision → consequences**, plus alternatives considered.

## Workflow

1. Copy `0000-template.md` → next number (e.g., `0006-my-decision.md`).
2. Write it in PR as `Proposed`.
3. Discuss; once merged, set Status to `Accepted` (or `Superseded` with a link).
4. Never edit the history of an Accepted ADR—create a new ADR to supersede it.

## Status values

- Proposed — drafted in a PR, under discussion.
- Accepted — merged and implemented (or planned next).
- Rejected — decision made not to proceed.
- Superseded — replaced by a newer ADR (link it).
