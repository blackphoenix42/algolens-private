> **Summary (non‑binding):** AlgoLens is an educational visualizer. Use it responsibly, don’t abuse the platform, and respect intellectual property. We provide the Service "as is" without warranties; we limit our liability as described below.

## 4) License to use the Service

Subject to these Terms, we grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service for personal, educational, or research purposes. Any commercial use requires our prior written consent unless otherwise permitted by an applicable open‑source license for code we publish.

## 5) Your content

You may submit content (e.g., datasets, notes, code snippets) to or through the Service.

- You retain your rights to your content. By submitting, you grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, store, display, and process your content solely to operate and improve the Service.
- Do not submit content you do not own or for which you lack permissions.
- You are responsible for ensuring your content does not contain personal or sensitive information you do not wish to share.

### Public areas

If you post in public areas (e.g., example galleries, shared links), your content may be visible to others. Do not post confidential information there.

---

## 6) Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- Access, tamper with, or use non‑public areas, systems, or technical delivery mechanisms of the Service.
- Probe, scan, or test vulnerabilities without permission; circumvent access controls; scrape in a manner that degrades the Service.
- Upload malicious code or content that infringes rights, is illegal, or violates our Code of Conduct.
- Misuse compute resources (e.g., denial‑of‑service, crypto mining, spam, automated high‑volume requests).

We may rate‑limit, throttle, or suspend access to protect the Service and users.

---

## 7) Sandbox & user code (if enabled)

Some features may allow running user code (e.g., TS/JS, WebAssembly) in a sandbox.

- Sandboxes are **best‑effort** and not a security boundary; do not run untrusted code you cannot audit.
- Network access from sandboxed code is disabled unless explicitly allowed.
- We may enforce CPU time, memory, and execution quotas. Excessive or abusive workloads may be terminated.
- You are responsible for code you execute and any third‑party rights it may implicate.

## 8) Educational use & schools (if applicable)

If you are an educator or institution:

- You are responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from students and complying with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, UK‑GDPR, India DPDP Act 2023, FERPA or local equivalents).
- Where provided, use privacy toggles (e.g., local‑only mode) to minimize personal data.

## 9) Third‑party services

The Service may integrate third‑party tools (e.g., analytics, error monitoring) **only with your consent**. Your use of third‑party services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.

---

## 10) Intellectual property

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by the AlgoLens Maintainers and/or its contributors and are protected by applicable laws. Portions of the code may be open‑sourced under separate licenses; those licenses govern your use of the code they cover.

### Feedback

If you send feedback or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use them without restriction or obligation to you.

We may add, change, or remove features at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to announce material changes. Some features may be labeled beta or experimental and may be discontinued at our discretion.
