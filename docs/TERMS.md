> **Summary (non‑binding):** AlgoLens is an educational visualizer. Use it responsibly, don’t abuse the platform, and respect intellectual property. We provide the Service "as is" without warranties; we limit our liability as described below.

## 4) License to use the Service

Any commercial use requires our prior written consent unless otherwise permitted by an applicable open‑source license for code we publish.

## 5) Your content

You may submit content (e.g., datasets, notes, code snippets) to or through the Service.

- You retain your rights to your content. By submitting, you grant us a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free license to host, store, display, and process your content solely to operate and improve the Service.
- Do not submit content you do not own or for which you lack permissions.

### Public areas

If you post in public areas (e.g., example galleries, shared links), your content may be visible to others. Do not post confidential information there.

---

## 6) Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- Access, tamper with, or use non‑public areas, systems, or technical delivery mechanisms of the Service.
- Probe, scan, or test vulnerabilities without permission; circumvent access controls; scrape in a manner that degrades the Service.
- Upload malicious code or content that infringes rights, is illegal, or violates our Code of Conduct.
- Misuse compute resources (e.g., denial‑of‑service, crypto mining, spam, automated high‑volume requests).

We may rate‑limit, throttle, or suspend access to protect the Service and users.

---

## 7) Sandbox & user code (if enabled)

Some features may allow running user code (e.g., TS/JS, WebAssembly) in a sandbox.

- Sandboxes are **best‑effort** and not a security boundary; do not run untrusted code you cannot audit.
- Network access from sandboxed code is disabled unless explicitly allowed.
- We may enforce CPU time, memory, and execution quotas. Excessive or abusive workloads may be terminated.
- You are responsible for code you execute and any third‑party rights it may implicate.

If you are an educator or institution:

- You are responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from students and complying with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, UK‑GDPR, India DPDP Act 2023, FERPA or local equivalents).
- Where provided, use privacy toggles (e.g., local‑only mode) to minimize personal data.

## 9) Third‑party services

The Service may integrate third‑party tools (e.g., analytics, error monitoring) **only with your consent**. Your use of third‑party services is subject to their terms and privacy policies.

---

## 10) Intellectual property

The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by the AlgoLens Maintainers and/or its contributors and are protected by applicable laws. Portions of the code may be open‑sourced under separate licenses; those licenses govern your use of the code they cover.
